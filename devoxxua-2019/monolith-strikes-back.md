## Monolith strikes back
### What it was about?
* Modular architecture with business accent (api-model architecture)
* Have used XXX-api modules with interfaces
* About Java 9 Jigsaw is not happy
* Have used framework for architecture testing - [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/)
* Gradle incremental builds
* Helps for testing modules - [Moduliths](https://github.com/odrotbohm/moduliths)
* [Spring boot structuring your code](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-structuring-your-code)

### How this talk influence to me (or to my teammates \ company)?
* It is pretty similar to what was described in another talk about testing.
