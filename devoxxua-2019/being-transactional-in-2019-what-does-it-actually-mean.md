## Being transactional in 2019 - what does it actually mean
### What it was about?
- Read official documentation, not marketing, not titles.
ACID in mongo? no! it was ACID for replicas and something for sharding.
- Isolation levels in databases. The same names - different meanings.

### Other
- there was really bad sound... no luck for us and for speaker

### How this talk influence to me (or to my teammates \ company)?
- i know many different things that was described, 
but due to sound i didn't get what is the main idea of the talk

`KeyTakeaways`: read official documentation and not titles!
